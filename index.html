                     <p> My name is Sotirios A. Tsaftaris but most people call me Sotos (in Greek Σωτήριος Α. Τσαυτάρης or Σώτος).
                     I am currently with the <b>University of Edinburgh</b> and the <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-sotirios-tsaftaris">
                     Institute of Digital Communications</a> as a Chancellor's Fellow and Reader (US equivalent Associate Professor).  Critically, I am also 
                     a <a href="https://www.raeng.org.uk/news/news-releases/2019/march/academy-announces-2019-research-chairs-and-senior">Canon Medical/Royal Academy of Engineering Senior Research Fellow in Healthcare AI</a>.  I am also a Fellow of the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a>. 
                     

            <p> My <b>research interests</b>  are machine learning, deep learning, medical image analysis (medical image computing), image processing, and distributed computing.
				Core <a href="Research.html">research</a> application domains are computer aided diagnosis in medicine
              and computer vision in agriculture (e.g. plant phenotyping, precision agriculture, agritech and indoor farming). 
            </p>
            <p>Within my web pages, you will find an <a href="Bio.html">extended Biography and CV</a>, <a href="Research.html">descriptions of my various research interests</a> as well as a list of <a href="Publications.html">publications</a>.
            <p>I would like to <a href="Acknowledgements.html">acknowledge</a> my <a href="Collaborations.html">collaborators</a>, and <a href="Acknowledgements.html">sponsors and supporters of my research program</a>.</p>
