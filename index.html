                     <p> My name is Sotirios A. Tsaftaris but most people call me Sotos (in Greek Σωτήριος Α. Τσαυτάρης or Σώτος).
                     I am currently with the <b>University of Edinburgh</b> and the <a href="https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/about/people/dr-sotirios-tsaftaris">
                     Insitute of Digital Communications</a> as a Chancellor's Fellow at a Senior Lecturer grade.

            <p> My <b>research interests</b>  are machine learning, medical image analysis (medical image computing), image processing, and distributed computing.
				Core <a href="Research.html">research</a> application domains are computer aided diagnosis in medicine
              and phenotyping.
            </p>
            <p>Within my web pages, you will find an <a href="Bio.html">extended Biography and CV</a>, <a href="Research.html">descriptions of my various research interests</a> as well as a list of <a href="Publications.html">publications</a>.
            <p>I would like to <a href="Acknowledgements.html">acknowledge</a> my <a href="Collaborations.html">collaborators</a>, and <a href="Acknowledgements.html">sponsors and supporters of my research program</a>.</p>
